# typescript-fullstack-sample

A sample project to demonstrate creating a full stack web app using TypeScript with Node.js and React.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a working terminal and Node.js installed. From there on after cloning just run `npm i` to install all dependenies in the project's folder.

Building is done via `npm run build`. After that you can just run `npm start` to get going. A dev server should be up and running at http://localhost:3000.

## What's covered?

- Client-side and Server-side rendering
- Global state container
- Hydration
- Building

## What's covered somewhere else?

I've recreated this whole sample also in Azure DevOps including CI/CD and a multi-project setup.

You'll find the link to the sample project below:

## What's not covered?

For the purpose of keeping the sample as minimal / down to the point as possible the following topics have been excluded:

- Watching / live development
- Advanced debugging
- Styling
- Anything with Redux

Getting these to run is actually not much of a problem, however, would significantly increase (reading) complexity.
